Note at the far left is the popup for Color Formats. This gives you six different choices for how color is used within the CSS. Note that two of these: hsla and rgba make use of an alpha channel. This allows you to control transparency within the gradient, which can be really useful with your layouts.",

        "detail": "Sometimes it becomes necessary to convert an object into a string in order to view or store it. For the purpose of debugging, a simple console.log() will suffice, as just about any modern browser’s Dev Tools will provide a pretty printed version of an object. Meanwhile, relying on implicit conversion when writing an object to any other location will only result in the utterly useless “[object Object]” string. Far better results can be achieved using JavaScript’s built-in JSON.stringify() method or by writing your own conversion function. Each of these will produce differing results, so it pays to carefully consider each option before deciding which approach best suits your requirements. With that in mind, we are going to try our hand at a few strategies here, including using the toSting() method, custom conversion methods, as well as the aforementioned JSON.stringify() in today’s web development tutorial.",
